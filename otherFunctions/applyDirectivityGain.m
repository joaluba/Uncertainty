%Function to apply gain depending on the direction of arrival
%INPUT:  v_DataPointIn    -data point consisting of two identical
%                          concatinated data points simulating binaural input where the source is in
%                          the center
%        az               -direction from which the source is coming
%                          (0째 -center, 270째 right side, 180째 behind center, 90째
%                          left side etc.)
%        s_type           - string containing the name of the directivity
%                           pattern we want to use (maybe it can be split
%                           to left and right?)
%
%OUTPUT: v_DataPointOut   -data point where an appropriate gain is applied
%                          to both "parts" of the concatenated data point.
%                          This simulates the binaural input.
%        G_L              -gain by which the left part of a pattern was
%                          multiplied
%        G_R              -gain by which the right part of a pattern was
